By identifying tick species with the highest vector competence and understanding their geographical distribution, this WP aims to elaborate risk assessments and develop tick control strategies. The insights gained will contribute to a predictive model for disease transmission risk, incorporating findings from WP1. To further emphasize the recycling aspect of the Six Rs of Sustainability, we plan to incorporate the genetic data of various tick species contributed by consortium members."
