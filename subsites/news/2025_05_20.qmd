## ✅ **Our OneTick project has been awarded MSCA Staff Exchanges!** 🎓

Not only is this our **first project of this kind**, we’re the **only project coordinated from Poland** among a total 19 proposals submitted by Polish-led consortia! 😲

👏 **Huge congratulations to Michał**, who led the application and tirelessly coordinated with all the partners. **Jarek and Valen** were deeply involved in writing and structuring the proposal, but the heavy lifting, all those calls and negotiations, was on Michał’s shoulders. And he nailed it 💪
