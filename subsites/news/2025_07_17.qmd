# 🕓 The waiting game begins

With the administrative marathon behind us, we can finally take a breath and start the countdown to 1 January 2026, when the project officially begins. 🎉

Between now and then, we’ll be:

*preparing exchange plans and training activities,

*finalizing data-sharing pipelines,

*and setting up our communication channels so we’re ready to roll from day one.

# 🙌 Thanks to the whole team!

This wouldn’t have happened without the patience and teamwork of all our partners, from handling countless forms to synchronizing legal teams across ten countries. Special thanks again to Michał Burdukiewicz and Jakub Wszeborowski, who navigated the bureaucracy like a pros, keeping everything on track and on time 💪.

# 🧬 What’s next?

As soon as the new year begins, our One Health tick-borne disease research officially takes off. We can’t wait to share updates from the first staff exchanges, workshops, and fieldwork across Europe! 🌍🕷️
