## ðŸŽ¯ Objectivs

This work package will develop a promotional strategy to share the results of this grant and promote evidence-based practices for treating tick-borne diseases. This will involve creating accessible educational materials, organizing workshops and conferences, and engaging with healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public. A key focus will be countering misinformation from well-organized superficially scientific groups that undermine scientifically and clinically supported treatments. By collaborating with medical societies and policy-makers and utilizing digital platforms, the strategy aims to build trust in evidence-based practices, enhance awareness of accurate diagnostics and treatment options, and provide reliable information to patients and practitioners. Ultimately, this effort will help elevate the standard of care for tick-borne diseases nationally and internationally.
