In this study, we aim to explore the interactions among ticks, their hosts, and the pathogens they carry to understand better the mechanisms involved in pathogen transmission and subsequent disease occurrence. We will use this information to identify the tick species that pose the most significant risk to humans and animals. By combining these findings with the results from Work Package 1, we hope to develop a model for assessing the risk of disease transmission based on geographical location."

    "text": "Work package 1 explores the dynamic interplay between climate change, urbanization, and tick ecology, focusing on the emergence and distribution of zoonotic risks in urban and peri-urban landscapes. We aim to assess how ticks adapt to human-dominated ecosystems by analyzing their presence in diverse urban and peri-urban environments like house gardens, playgrounds or public parks. We will use sampling techniques to compare tick abundance and species diversity across these environments, identify pathogens of tick-borne diseases, and assess potential cross-zone transmission pathways. To make this analysis more robust, we will consider cities within cities in different climate ranges. This will foster a deeper understanding of urban microclimates as incubators for biodiversity shifts under climate pressure. Moreover, this interdisciplinary and globally connected approach will generate actionable insights for public health and urban resilience strategies."

    "text": "The rise in tick-borne diseases, combined with insufficient awareness campaigns, has contributed to the spread of misinformation on this topic. Some organizations, such as ILADS, exploit this lack of understanding, harming public health through propagating seemingly merit-based guidelines. ILADS protocol could result in drug overdosing and delayed diagnosis of real underlying diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune diseases, limiting the patient’s chance to survive. However, its effects permeate society by increasing the environment for developing antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Additionally, anti-vaccine activism (or any other resistance to immunization efforts) hinders efforts to control preventable tick-borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis. Therefore, this work package will facilitate the development of a promotional strategy to disseminate the results of this grant proposal and share best practices for treating tick-borne diseases despite the presence of non-evidence-based resources and active propaganda from groups like ILADS."

Using the collected data (anamnesis, demographic data, clinical presentation, basic laboratory examinations from blood and cerebrospinal fluid), we will construct statistical models to predict survival outcomes and the probability of experiencing long-term complications resulting from these diseases. The models could be later extended with the omics data obtained in other studies and lead to predictive models to assess survival rates and the likelihood of long-term complications associated with tick-borne diseases. Moreover, this work package will lead to the symptom database that would help identify sequelae of tick-borne diseases, which will be crucial in the field that is still symptom-based and lacks good laboratory diagnostics."

    "text": "Biomarkers utilized in serological assays do not provide definitive information regarding disease activity, such as in the case of Lyme disease. Furthermore, they fail to identify patients who will experience post-treatment symptoms. A robust set of new biomarkers could help address the underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of tick-borne diseases. Therefore, this initiative focuses on identifying new biomarkers that can specify particular tick-borne diseases and their sequelae through an omics approach by re-analyzing existing omics datasets. This will lead to biomarkers in potential cases TBE who developed sequelae or PTLDS (Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome). However, although these two diseases will be the main focus of this work package, we plan also to improve diagnostics and reporting of neglected tick-borne diseases, including anaplasmosis and rickettsioses. Hence, this work package will finally result in the holistic point-of-care panel for diagnosing tick-borne diseases."
