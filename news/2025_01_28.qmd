Of course I will not let you check all these facts so here is an corrected list of the facts presented before:

1.  Octopuses can edit their own genes on the fly.
2.  Bananas contain radiation, but not enough to make you glow in the dark.
3.  The human body has more bacterial cells than human ones.
4.  Saturn would float in water if you had a big enough bathtub.
5.  Water is not dry at the molecular level—this was nonsense.
6.  Wombat poop is cube-shaped. Scientists think it helps prevent rolling.
7.  The Moon is moving away from Earth by 4 cm every year.
8.  Spiders can taste with their legs, but there’s no evidence they hate sugar.
9.  Sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphins—up to 40 minutes!
10. There’s a planet (HD 189733b) where it rains molten glass sideways at 7,000 km/h.
